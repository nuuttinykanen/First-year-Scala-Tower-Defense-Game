17.3.2021 PROGRESS CHECKPOINT #1

For the first checkpoint, I have thus far:

 - Created bases for all classes in the UML (without actual implementation for methods)

 - Worked significantly on reading text files and importing enemy waves and player stats from them. (Still in progress)

 - Imported grid and scala.swing
    * this took a lot of extra time as the imports didn't work at first. Now they seemingly function correctly.

I have thus far tested that the reader reads the file and returns waves in chunks. The reader doesn't correctly import enemy types but this is easily fixed.

I am currently, in my opinion, behind schedule. This is because of school work and an honest lack of motivation.
I will work on this significantly more in the coming two weeks. I aim to have experience with GUI by the next checkpoint.

Workload: 8 to 10 hours
