/** An object of type `GridPos` represents a pair of integer coordinates on two axes named x and y.
  * Such a pair can be used to reference a point on a [[Grid]].
  *
  * In this coordinate system, `x` increases "eastwards" and `y` increases "southwards".
  *
  * `GridPos` objecta are immutable.
  *
  * This class has an alias in the top-level package [[o1]], so itâ€™s accessible to students
  * simply via `import o1._`.
  *
  * @param x  an x coordinate
  * @param y  a y coordinate */
